"""
Infrastructure components for Fizko platform.

This package contains technical infrastructure components that provide
foundational services to the application, such as:

- Task queues and background job processing (Celery)
- Caching mechanisms (Redis)
- File storage abstractions
- Message queues
- Search engines
- Monitoring and observability

These components are distinct from business integrations (integrations/)
in that they provide technical capabilities rather than domain-specific
external service connections.
